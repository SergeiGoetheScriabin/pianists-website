                <p>"As a man who reflects on the subject of art and as a teacher I find that one my most fascinating occupations is the analysis of the laws of materialistic dialectic, which are emobided in the clearly and precisely as they are in real life. How interesting and instructive it is to follow the laws of conflict between contradictions, to see how in music, just as in life in general, thesis, and antithesis leads to synthesis. We sometimes devote a great deal of time to such discussions in my class. A pianist who knows and feels these laws will always plays better than the pianists who does not know them or cannot fathom them."
